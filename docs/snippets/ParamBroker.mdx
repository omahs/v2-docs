### Broker

An optional parameter that can be set in order to charge a fee as a percentage of `totalAmount`.

In the following example, we will leave this parameter uninitialized (i.e. set to zero), because it doesn't make sense
to charge yourself a fee. In practice, this parameter will mostly be used by front-end applications.

```solidity
params.broker = Broker(address(0), ud60x18(0));
```

Wondering what's up with that `ud60x18` function? It's a casting function that wraps a basic integer to the `UD60x18`
value type. This type is part of the math library [PRBMath](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-math), which is used in
Sablier for fixed-point calculations.
